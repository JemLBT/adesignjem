          <h3>About me</h3>
          <h4>
            <br />
            After 15 years working with children + young people, I've decided to
            persue my passion in design + tech. <br /><br />I've always loved
            designing things, from posters to creating brands in my free time, I
            am truly obsessed. <br /><br />
            I took the plunge in 2024 by enrolling on the SheCodes full
            developer course and have not looked back. <br /><br />
            I qualified as a Junior Web Developer in Spring 2025 + continue to
            build + develop my skills (literally).

          <h3>Experience</h3>
          <h4>
            <br />
            Whilst living in London, I was part of the
            <a href="https://www.nonchalantmagazine.com">Nonchalant Magazine</a>
            writers team, which involved researching and writing content, using
            Wordpress, including SEO + social media<br /><br />In 2022 I
            volunteered as a Website Designer for
            <a href="https://www.numberfit.com">NumberFit</a> where I designed
            their home page hero, about page + supported with their other
            projects such as Maths Week England.<br /><br />
            I have designed multiple websites for weddings which have been coded
            by developers, including my own. <br /><br />
            Now I have the skills to design + build websites myself!
